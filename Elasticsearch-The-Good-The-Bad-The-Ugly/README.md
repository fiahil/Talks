## Elasticsearch - the Good, the Bad and the Ugly

This talk will cover the basic use cases of Elasticsearch. Like the official documentation, it will first cover ES' basic vocabulary and features, then go onto a more detailed explanation on search and aggregations. A 2nd more advanced presentation will cover advanced topics and use cases later.

Examples will be provided using Scala's Elastic4s library DSL and raw JSON queries.


## Quick start

- Import the `build.sbt` file into your favorite IDE.
- Open `elastic.sc`
- Tada!
